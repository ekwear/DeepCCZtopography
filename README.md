# DeepCCZtopography
Bioinformatics code used in 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of DeepCCZ cruise samples comparing abyssal plains and seamounts. Code will eventually cover 1) ASV generation and further QCing; 2) differential abundance analysis of ASVs using DESeq2 but is currently a work in progress.
